<p>Hello! My name is Elaine Butler. I'm a transfer student. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering but can't take any classes in it until my transfer credits are sorted out.
<br />I've always enjoyed creating websites as a hobby so I'm happy to take classes on it.
<br />My favorite colors are...
<ul><li>Green</li><li>Blue</li><li>Black</li></ul>
<br />But mostly just green really.</p>
